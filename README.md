# Ford GoBike Data - Exploratory Analysis
## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the month of February 2019. For this project, the data was made available by Udacity with this link [dataset](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv)


## Summary of Findings

> After cleaning and data exploration was done on the dataset, the following insights were acknowledged:
#### Most people ride the bike for around 10 minutes
> This was found after plotting a histogram to show the average duration of rides. Because some outliers on the high end extremely skewed the data, a logrithmic transformation was done here.

#### People tends to ride more frequently during the weekdays than weekends
> This was found after plotting a bar chart to show what days in the week had more riders.

#### People ride more frequently between 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM.
> This was found after plotting a bar chart to show what hour in the day had more riders.

#### Majority of people taking the rides are between age 20 to 40
> This was found after plotting a histogram to show the distribution of riders by their age.

#### Majority of the people riding the bikes are Male
> This was found after plotting a barchart to show the various gender of riders

#### People between the ages of 20 to 60 tend to take the longest rides
> This was found after plotting a scatterplot to find the relationship between ride duration and rider's Age

#### Longer duration of ride are taken during the weekend(saturday and sunday).
> This is found after plotting a barchart to show the relationship between days of the week and ride duration

#### Although 3am has the lowest ride frequency, 3am has the longest ride duration
> This is found after plotting a barchart to show the relationship between hour of the day and ride duration

#### San Antomio Park, Palm St at Willow St, Foothill Blvd at 42nd Ave are the top 3 start stations with the longest ride duration
> This was found after plotting a horizontal barchart to show the relationship start stations and ride duration

#### Customers takes longer rides compared to subscribers
> This was found after plotting a boxplot to show the relationship between user-type and ride Duration

#### Both female and other gender rides longer trips then males.
> This was found after plotting a boxplot to show the relationship between gender and ride Duration

#### Irrespective of the gender, the durations taper off as a person gets older.
> This was found by plotting a scatter plot to show th relationship between gender, age aride duration.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, we would be looking at three insights:

1. People tends to ride more frequently during the weekdays
2. Majority of the people riding the bikes are Male
3. Customers takes longer rides compared to subscribers
4. Irrespective of the gender, the durations taper off as a person gets older.# Ford-GoBike
